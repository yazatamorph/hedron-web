# Privacy

Hedron's team is committed to collecting as little information about you as possible, and what we collect is never sold or shared. Your information is only used to provide the app's functionality - nothing more, nothing less.

So, what do we collect?

If you create an account in our archive (available at [https://hedronarchive.com](https://hedronarchive.com)), we collect two kinds of information:

1. your email address, and
2. data you provide about your card collection.

We use your email address to allow you to access your account and to provide support services. It's never shared or publicly visible, and we'll only use it to contact you regarding your account - for example, to confirm account creation or to reply to your contact form submissions. Likewise, the data you provide about your card collection is not shared. We do our best to mitigate the possibility of your data being accessed without your authorization by enforcing secure connections with HTTPS and WSS, as well as implementing security features like CSP and HSTS.

Hedron doesn't use cookies to provide services. Instead, user identity and authentication is handled within the browser using the decentralized GUN ecosystem of tools, which you can read about [here](https://gun.eco/). Your data is primarily held in your browser using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), and it's replicated and relayed by the Hedron archive peer for the convenience of those who want an app that just works. Our goal is to be a completely decentralized, offline-first app, and our code is free and open source, so if you prefer to have more fine-grained control of your information - or any other aspect of the app! - you're both welcome and encouraged to [fork our repository on GitHub](https://github.com/yazatamorph/hedron-web) and run your own instances.

## Legal Disclosures

Hedron is hosted and run in the United States. As such, we are bound by United States law, which means we may be required to disclose information about your account in order to comply with court orders and legal process, defend our rights or property, and/or defend the rights or property of others. However, we will only disclose the minimum information required for compliance, and only after careful review of the request. We'll always work to reject requests that are overly broad, vague, or simply unclear. In any case when we must disclose your information, we will notify you as soon as we're able using the email address you provided during registration.
