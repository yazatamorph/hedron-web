      such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms "User", "you" or
      "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or
      if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept
      this Agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. You
      acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the
      Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by
